# Salesplanet/Immoplanet Datenschutz Scripts

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript userscripts developed to streamline and simplify daily work processes. Every script has its concept from me, and written using Google Gemini AI.

## Scripts

The following userscripts are included in this repository:

-   **`Immoplanet - Datenschutz worker.user.js`**: A userscript likely designed to assist with data protection (Datenschutz) related tasks on the Immoplanet platform.
    
-   **`Salesplanet - Datenschutz worker.user.js`**: A userscript likely designed to assist with data protection (Datenschutz) related tasks on the Salesplanet platform.


## Script Installation and Usage


These scripts are designed to be installed using a browser extension like **Tampermonkey**. If you're unfamiliar with Tampermonkey, it's a popular userscript manager that allows you to run custom JavaScript on webpages.

For detailed instructions on how to install userscripts with Tampermonkey, please refer to the [Tampermonkey FAQ](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en).

Once installed, these scripts simplify your workflow by automating the process of **filling specific fields and replacing data** on web pages. While the exact steps will depend on the specific script and the page you're on, their core function is to streamline repetitive data entry and manipulation.
